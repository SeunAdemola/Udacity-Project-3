# Communicate Data Findings
## by Seun Bola Ademola


## Dataset

This project involves exploratory data visualization. Python libraries were used to visualize 
and systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and 
building up to plots of multiple variables.
The data set selected is  a US bank's loan containing different attributes that describes 
customer. The initial dataset contained 18324 rows and 31 columns.This was 
later reduced to 15863 entries and columns after cleaning. The major aim is to explore the different attributes to identify 
pattern that describes a fully paid loan and charged off loans.


## Summary of Findings
Now-a-days, several people apply for loans for various reasons. 
However, there are several cases where people do not repay the amount which causes huge financial loss.
Hence, by using this way we can classify the loaners among all, it would prevent the huge financial loss.
From a proper analysis of the component some of the observations made includes:

*The most common purpose for which people take a loan is for debt consolidation followed by credit 
card loan which could be for different day to day transaction. Only few loans were taking for house, 
renewable energy, and wedding purpose. No loan was taken for educational purpose.

*78.9% of all the loans given out was fully paid, while 21.1% were Charged Off Loans

*While there is no much differece between the amount of loan taken by 
those that fully pained and those that were charge off, there is a slight difference in their mean value.
 Those with loans that are charge of on average, takes slightly a larger amount of loana that were able to fully pay.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on some key attributes to identify pattern that describes a fully paid loan and charged off loans data. 
At first I introduced the univariate analysis of some of these variables after which I proceeded to the Bivariate plot to further visualize the 
Relationship between the combination of some of the variable. The Final give a brief of the multivariate analysis.
Bar chart was used to visualize the Top ten most common job titles among the customers.
An histrogram was used to visualize the distribution of the loan amound. I further checked the relationship between instrest rate and loan amount. 
The analysis showed that there is no correlation between the interest rate and the loan amont. 
This may indicate the interest rate that there interest rate the bank give may depend on other variables such as the loan purpose.
